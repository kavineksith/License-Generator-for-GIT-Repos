# **License Generator Script Documentation**

## **Overview**
This script automates the process of generating a LICENSE file for open-source repositories based on user-specified open-source licenses. It supports popular licenses such as **MIT**, **Apache 2.0**, and **BSD** (various versions). The script fetches the license template from a JSON file, replaces placeholders with the current year and user name, and saves the generated LICENSE text into a file named `LICENSE`.

Additionally, it includes error handling, custom exceptions, and logging features for tracking actions and errors during the process.

---

## **Features**
- **Load License Templates**: Fetches open-source license templates from a JSON file.
- **User Customization**: Accepts a user-specified name (or organization name) for the generated license.
- **Error Handling**: Catches and raises custom exceptions for various errors (e.g., invalid license name, file errors).
- **Logging**: Tracks all actions and errors in a log file (`license_generator.log`).

---

## **Classes and Methods**

### **LicenseError (Base Exception)**
A base exception class for handling all license-related errors.

#### **Attributes**:
- `message`: The error message.

### **InvalidLicenseName (LicenseError)**
Raised when an invalid license name is provided by the user.

#### **Attributes**:
- `message`: The error message.

### **LicenseGenerationError (LicenseError)**
Raised when there is an error generating the license text.

#### **Attributes**:
- `message`: The error message.

### **LicenseFileError (LicenseError)**
Raised when there is an error saving the license file.

#### **Attributes**:
- `message`: The error message.

### **LicenseGenerator**
A class that handles the license generation process, including loading templates, generating the license text, and saving it to a file.

#### **Methods**:

- **`__init__(self, license_name, user_name=None)`**
  - **Purpose**: Initializes the license generator with the provided license name and optional user name.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `license_name` (str): The name of the license (e.g., "MIT", "Apache-2.0").
    - `user_name` (str, optional): The name of the user or organization (default is `None`).
  - **Raises**: None.

- **`load_licenses(self)`**
  - **Purpose**: Loads license templates from a JSON file (`licenses.json`).

  - **Raises**:
    - `LicenseError`: If the `licenses.json` file is not found or contains invalid JSON.

- **`generate_license_text(self)`**

  - **Returns**: The generated license text as a string.
  - **Raises**:
    - `InvalidLicenseName`: If the selected license is not found in the available licenses.
    - `LicenseGenerationError`: If there is an error generating the license text.

- **`save_license_file(self, license_text)`**
  - **Purpose**: Saves the generated license text to a file named `LICENSE`.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `license_text` (str): The generated license text.
  - **Raises**:
    - `LicenseFileError`: If there is an error saving the file (e.g., file permissions or IO errors).

- **`create_license(self)`**
  - **Purpose**: Orchestrates the full process of generating and saving the license.
  - **Returns**: None.
  - **Raises**:
    - `LicenseError`: For any issues encountered during the license generation or saving process.

## **Script Execution Flow**

1. **User Input**:
   - The script first asks the user to input a **license name** (e.g., "MIT", "Apache-2.0", etc.) and optionally a **user name** (or organization name).
   - If no license name is provided, the script raises an `InvalidLicenseName` exception.
   - If no user name is provided, a default name "Your Name or Organization" is used.

2. **License Generation**:
   - The script loads license templates from a `licenses.json` file.
   - It verifies that the provided license name exists in the file and generates the corresponding license text by replacing placeholders (current year and user name).

3. **Saving License**:
   - The generated license text is saved to a file named `LICENSE` in the current working directory.
   - If an error occurs during this process, an `LicenseFileError` is raised.

4. **Logging**:
   - All actions and errors are logged in a file named `license_generator.log`.
   - Logs include info about the process (e.g., license generation) as well as error details (e.g., invalid license names, file errors).

## **Example of Logging Output (`license_generator.log`)**

```plaintext
2025-01-26 10:15:30,123 - INFO - Licenses loaded successfully.
2025-01-26 10:15:31,456 - INFO - License text generated for MIT.
2025-01-26 10:15:32,789 - INFO - LICENSE file saved successfully.
2025-01-26 10:15:33,111 - INFO - License creation process completed successfully.
```

```plaintext
2025-01-26 10:20:45,234 - ERROR - licenses.json file not found.
2025-01-26 10:20:46,567 - ERROR - Error generating license text: License 'Unknown' not found in the available licenses.
```

---

## **Exception Handling**

- **License Name Errors**: 
  - If the user provides an invalid license name, an `InvalidLicenseName` exception is raised.
  
- **File Errors**: 
  - If there is an issue loading the `licenses.json` file or saving the `LICENSE` file, appropriate exceptions (`LicenseFileError`, `LicenseGenerationError`) will be raised.

- **User Interruptions**: 
  - If the user interrupts the process using `Ctrl+C`, a `KeyboardInterrupt` is caught, and the script logs the interruption.

---

## **Example Usage**

### **Step 1: Run the Script**
```bash
python license_generator.py
```

### **Step 2: Provide License and User Information**
```plaintext
Enter the license name (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause): MIT
Enter your name or organization (or press Enter to skip): John Doe
```

### **Step 3: Result**
After successful execution, the script will generate the `LICENSE` file with the following contents (for MIT):

```plaintext
